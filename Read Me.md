However, in between inefficient management, lack of political will, and inadequate infrastructure, the electricity problem remains a behemoth standing on the way of businesses, and technological progress as well.While I do not believe that it is a problem that can be solved by an individual, I am of the opinion that a significant first step will be to acquire and process reliable data about the country’s electricity supply. Important variables like the output based on geographical locations over the past couple of years, the renewable and traditional energy sources available also by geographical location, potential sites for building plants and so on.Although I am not completely sure about the details and intricacies of how this is going to work out, I believe that understanding Data Science and combining it with my background knowledge in Engineering will help in setting up the all-important data analytics and prediction foundation on which the revamping of the Nigerian electricity system will be built.#Create My DataScience Profile￼##Literature Review###Book: Electric Power Generation ###Journals: Nigeria Electricity Industry: Issues, Challenges, and Solutions –Covenant University Research Paper Electricity Generation and the Present Challenges in the Nigerian Power Sector- Research Gate Energy Consumption, Financial Development and Economic Growth in Nigeria- IJSSHR research paper ###News Articles/Blogs: The Way Forward For Electricity Supply in Nigeria- National Geographic The Electricity Situation in Nigeria- Edmund Olotu on Medium NIGERIA: Power Africa Fact Sheet- USAID Electricity Situation and Potential Development in Nigeria Challenges and Intervention Needs in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry- CSEA Blog Nigeria Energy Situation- energypedia.info Estimating Residential Electricity Consumption in Nigeria mdpi.com/pdf Country Report on the Nigerian Energy System- eneken.ieej.or.jp Powering Nigeria For the Future. – PWC sector report The Nigerian Energy Sector- GIZ research study.
